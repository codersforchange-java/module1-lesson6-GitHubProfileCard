### Exercise 1: My First Fork & Clone

**Goal:** Get your own personal copy of this project on your computer.

1.  **Fork this Repository:** Click the **"Fork"** button in the top-right corner of this page. This creates your own copy of the project on your GitHub account.
2.  **Clone Your Fork:**
    * Navigate to **your forked repository** on GitHub (the URL should now have your username).
    * Click the green **"< > Code"** button and copy the **HTTPS URL**.
    * In Visual Studio Code, open the Command Palette, type `Git: Clone`, and press Enter.
    * Paste the URL you copied and choose a location on your computer to save the project.
    * Open the cloned project folder in VS Code.

### Exercise 2: The Feature Branch Workflow

**Goal:** Update your profile card on a safe, separate branch.

1.  **Create a New Branch:** In the bottom-left corner of VS Code, click on the branch name (it should say `main`). From the menu, select **"Create new branch"**. Name your new branch `feature/add-profile-name` and press Enter.
2.  **Make a Code Change:**
    * Open the file: `src/com/codersforchange/profile/ProfileCard.java`.
    * Find the line with the placeholder text `[YOUR GITHUB USERNAME HERE]`.
    * Replace that placeholder text with your actual GitHub username.
3.  **Stage & Commit:**
    * Go to the **Source Control** panel in VS Code.
    * Click the **plus icon (+)** next to the `ProfileCard.java` file to stage it.
    * In the "Message" box, type a clear commit message like `feat: Add GitHub username to profile card`.
    * Click the **checkmark icon** to commit your change.

### Exercise 3: Pushing and Merging a Pull Request

**Goal:** Publish your updated profile card and merge it.

1.  **Push Your Branch:** In VS Code, click the **"Publish Branch"** button to upload your new branch and its commit to your GitHub repository.
2.  **Create a Pull Request (PR):**
    * Open your browser again and go to your forked repository on GitHub. You should see a banner prompting you to **"Compare & pull request"**. Click it.
3.  **Merge Your Pull Request:**
    * Give your Pull Request a title, like "Update Profile Card".
    * Click **"Create pull request"**, and on the next screen, click **"Merge pull request"** and confirm.

**ü•≥ Congratulations! You have personalized your profile card and completed the fundamental workflow used by developers every day!**

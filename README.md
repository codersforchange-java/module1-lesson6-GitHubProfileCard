## 📂 Project Structure and Your Task

Inside the project, you will find two main packages/directories in the `src` folder:

* `[com.codersforchange.exercise.code.here]`: This is where you will write your code. You are expected to modify the files within this package to complete the exercise.
* `[com.codersforchange.must.not.touch]`: ⚠️ **IMPORTANT!** You must **not** edit any files inside this package. These files are used to test your code, and any changes will cause the tests to fail!

## ✅ Testing Your Work Locally

Before you consider the exercise complete, you should run the provided unit tests to see if your code works as expected.

In your IDE's file explorer, find the `[MainTest.java]` file within the `src/test/java/com/codersforchange/must/not/touch` folder. You should see a small "run" icon next to the test methods or the class name itself. Click it to execute the tests.

* **✅ If all tests pass (you see green checkmarks), congratulations! You are on the right track.**
* **❌ If any tests fail (you see red crosses), the output in the terminal will give you clues as to what might be wrong. Review the exercise requirements and your code, fix the issues, and run the tests again.**

### üìÇ Project Structure

This project follows a standard Java project structure:

```

  main/
    java/
      com/
        codersforchange/
          profile/
            ProfileCard.java   # The file you'll be modifying
```

### 3. Stage & Commit
 * Go to the  ![source-control](assets/source-control.png)  **Source Control** panel in VS Code.
 * Click the **plus icon (+)** next to the `ProfileCard.java` file to stage it.

![commit](assets/commit.png)

 * In the "Message" box, type a clear commit message like `feat: Add GitHub username to profile card`.
 * Click the **Commit** button to commit your change.

## Exercise 3: Pushing and Merging a Pull Request

### 1.  **Push Your Branch:** 

In VS Code, click the **"Publish Branch"** button to upload your new branch and its commit to your GitHub repository.
